            </div>The hardy breed originating from Poland have been bred since 2003 at the National Trust's Wicken Fen nature reserve in Cambridgeshire.

They leave water-filled hoof prints and piles of dung as they go, which can help attract new species of flora and fauna to the lowland landscape.

Cattle also help to manage the land.

Rangers have named 10 of the newborn ponies - Victor, Ginger, Rigel, Oliver, Argo, Pilgrim, Sprout, Sylvester, Pie and Beric - after horses in film and TV.<img class="media" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHZDYiuCRs00XIXN_gDDnFsY9X3tIpt5SNEg&usqp=CAU" alt=""></p>

            </div>The breed is distinctive, as stallions can sometimes be seen rearing up on their hind legs and sparring with each other in a display of dominance during the foaling season.

Four baby Highland cows, the latest of which was born on Tuesday - the 100th to be born at Wicken Fen since breeding started in 2005 - have also joined the herd, which is helping to manage vegetation at the reserve.

The first two female calves have been named Malin and Bailey, after areas on the shipping forecast.</p>
